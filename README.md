# MASSA ðŸ¦— Acheta


Acheta is a genus of crickets. It most notably contains the house cricket (Acheta domesticus).

"Massa ðŸ¦— Acheta" is a service that will notify you about events occurring on your MASSA node and your wallet. Just like a little cricket!

Before we jump to a detailed description of the service, please watch this video:
